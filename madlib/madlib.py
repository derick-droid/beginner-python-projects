Human activities generate three broad sources of {first_noun} pollution: stationary or point, mobile, and
indoor. In developing countries especially in the {second_noun} area, indoor air pollution {adjective_1} using
open fires for cooking and heating may be a serious problem. Industries, power plants etc. are
the cause of stationary air pollution. But in urban areas â€“ both developing and developed
countries, it is predominantly mobile or vehicular pollution that contributes to overall air
quality problem. In Delhi, the data shows that of the total 3,000 metric tonnes of pollutants1
belched out everyday, close to two-third (66%) is from vehicles. Similarly, the contribution of
vehicles to urban air pollution is 52% in Bombay and close to one-third in Calcutta.2
 Katz
(1994) has estimated that in Santiago, Chile, wherever pollution concentration exceeds ambient
standards, mobile sources or vehicles are the cause. Similarly, in case of Budapest, Hungary,
transport is the dominant source of emissions except sulphur dioxide (SO2), contributing 57%
of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), 80% of lead (Pb), 81% of carbon monoxide (CO) and 75% of
hydrocarbon (HC) emissions (Lehoczki, 2000).

A number of countries have targeted vehicles and associated sectors (such as, fuel) to
curb the menace. Notable successful initiatives are: conversion of public transport from diesel
to CNG in Delhi, switching of Vikrams (tuk-tuks) from diesel to electricity in Kathmandu
valley, shifting from leaded to unleaded gasoline in many countries etc. Still the pollution
problem in urban cities may continue to loom large due to ever-burgeoning vehicular
population, which is outpacing any such measure and road network development. Following
data gives a glimpse of such skewed growth. Against 1.9 million vehicular population in 19
